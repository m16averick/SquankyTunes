# Squanky Tunes

Hi! I'm Mike from Poland and this is my first try with **Unity**. 


# Concept

Game will be mobile endless runner with various game modes (collected as powerups). First mode is endless runner with passing platforms without falling, and hitting enemies or sliding under the trunks.

Second mode will be airplane with throttle and shooting and the tird about moving into ground (and changing direction of gameplay).

## Inspiration

To become game developer I'm following gameplusjames's instructions, which are very satysfying. You can find his channel on YouTube:

## Tune yourself and wait for relase

Whole progress can be observed in this repository. I push only working versions of game.
